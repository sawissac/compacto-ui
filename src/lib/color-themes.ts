/**
 * Color theme catalog — the runtime palettes behind the `--app-*` token
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * Each {@link ColorTheme} is a complete, self-contained palette — background,
 * three surface elevations, one accent, and text — rather than a `light` /
 * `dark` binary layered on top of a fixed accent. Selecting a theme fully
 * determines the appearance (see {@link ColorTheme.isLight}); there is no
 * separate light/dark toggle.
 *
 * That is why no component class in this library carries a `dark:` variant.
 * A `dark:` clause would encode a second, parallel answer to a question the
 * palette has already answered, and the two would drift. The `.dark` class
 * still goes on the root element — {@link ColorTheme.isLight} decides — but
 * only so third-party CSS (Monaco, KaTeX, shiki) and the pre-hydration
 * defaults in `tokens.css` can key off it.
 *
 * Pure data plus one pure mapping function — no React, no framework.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { appThemeCssVars, COLOR_THEMES } from "@/lib/color-themes";
 *
 * const theme = COLOR_THEMES.midnight;
 * for (const [name, value] of Object.entries(appThemeCssVars(theme))) {
 *   document.documentElement.style.setProperty(name, value);
 * }
 * document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", !theme.isLight);
 * ```

 * Turn a {@link ColorTheme} into the `--app-*` custom properties that the

 * style — usually `document.documentElement` — to repaint everything below it.
 *
 * Nothing is folded: every tone in the palette gets its own variable. That is
 * the point of this vocabulary versus a semantic one, which has to collapse
 * `bgSelected`, `borderAccent`, `accentFaint`, `text`, `editorBg` and
 * `gutterBg` into their nearest neighbours.
 *
 * `--app-on-solid` is derived rather than stored: text on a solid accent block
 * needs the opposite of the accent, which is white on a light theme and the
 * page background on a dark one.
 *
 * Apps still using shadcn semantic utilities in their own code should import
 * `./compat-shadcn.css` (see `src/styles/`), which aliases those variables
 * onto these.
